# Jumbled

_noun_, a spelling game where you need to find all the anagrams before running out of moves.

## Current Status

This game is a work-in-progress.

### Remaining Tasks

- Keyboard support for drag+drop
- Screen reader aria live announcements
- Improved hints system (don't reuse hints, show multiple hints at once)
- Improved success/failure effects
- Improved game rules and game play
- Performance improvements (lazy load jumbles)
- PWA features (and getting in the app stores)
- Logo/icons
- Finalized design and type choices
- Consistent CSS organization
- Home Screen
- Improve UI grammar (singular/plural, including "and" in lists of words)
- Remove slurs and other offensive words from word set

### Bugs

- Starting jumble is sometimes a match
- Finding a hint word doesn't hide the hint
- Responsive font sizing is not working correctly
